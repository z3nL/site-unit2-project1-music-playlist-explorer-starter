### Reflection

* Did the topics discussed in your labs prepare you to complete the assignment? Be specific, which features in your weekly assignment did you feel unprepared to complete?

I think the topics discussed in our labs adequately prepared me to complete the assignment. I was a bit unconfident in my ability to work with fetching data,
but the Virtual Book Club lab refreshed my memory very well.

* If you had more time, what would you have done differently? Would you have added additional features? Changed the way your project responded to a particular event, etc.
  
If I had more time, I definitely would have given more attention to my project's appearance. It's layout is simple and easy on the eyes, but
there definitely could have been more added in terms of visual appeal. I also would have liked to go further with adding new playlists and fully incorporating it into the interactive data.

* Reflect on your project demo, what went well? Were there things that maybe didn't go as planned? Did you notice something that your peer did that you would like to try next time?

I personally did not demo my project, but one thing I saw my peers King and Wellington do that I really liked was actively updating search results as they
were typed, rather than wait on a form submission. That seems very intuitive and I'd love to implement something similar the next time I get the chance to.

### Open-source libraries used

I did not use any open-source libraries

### Shout out

Huge shoutouts to Jack, Mark, and TJ! Our instructors were super helpful, but having them right next to me and helping each other fill in the 
smaller blanks in our heads was a great experience.
